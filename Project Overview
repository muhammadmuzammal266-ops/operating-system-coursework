Project Overview

This technical journal documents the configuration, security hardening, and performance evaluation of a Linux server operating system. The coursework is completed over seven weeks and focuses on command-line
administration, operating system security, and system performance analysis.
A dual-system architecture is used, consisting of a headless Linux server managed remotely from a separate workstation using SSH. This reflects real-world system administration and cloud infrastructure practices.

System Architecture Summary

It consists of:

Server: Ubuntu Server
IP address: 192.168.56.101
Accessed only via SSH

Workstation: Fedora Linux
IP address: 192.168.56.102
Used for administration, monitoring, and testing

Both systems are connected using a VirtualBox host-only network, ensuring all testing is isolated and secure.
